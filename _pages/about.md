Ciao! I am a PhD researcher in Economics at the European University Institute in Florence :it:, supervised by Professors [Giancarlo Corsetti](https://sites.google.com/site/giancarlocorsetti/) and [Leonardo Melosi](https://sites.google.com/site/lemelosi/).

 My ongoing research examines the transmission of monetary policy, with a particular focus on the role of heterogeneity in household balance sheets. I am also interested in the propagation of other macroeconomic shocks and their contribution to business cycle fluctuations.

Before starting my PhD, I earned a Master’s degree in Economics from the University of Copenhagen :denmark: and a Bachelor’s degree in Economics from the University of São Paulo :brazil:

I’m always happy to chat about research! Please don’t hesitate to get in touch.
