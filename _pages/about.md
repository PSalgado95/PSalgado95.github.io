Ciao! I’m a PhD researcher in Economics at the European University Institute in Florence, Italy. My supervisors are Professors Giancarlo Corsetti and Leonardo Melosi.

I’m a macroeconomist and my main research interests are in monetary policy, business cycles, and the role of household balance sheets.
