**Monetary Policy and Unhedged Interest-Rate Exposures *(Draft coming soon)***  


This paper examines the transmission of monetary policy to household consumption through the lens of Unhedged Interest-Rate Exposures (UREs)—a welfare metric that measures how sensitive a household’s cash flow is to changes in interest rates, depending on the maturity of its assets and liabilities. Using Danish administrative data on income, wealth, and mortgage contracts from 2009 to 2019, I impute consumption, estimate UREs, and sort households by their exposures. I find a clear, monotonic gradient: households with the most negative exposures cut spending the most after a monetary-policy shock, while those with positive exposures increase it. In contrast, sorting by income, net worth, or liquid assets reveals little systematic variation. The gradient is especially pronounced among hand-to-mouth households, highlighting the interplay between liquidity constraints and interest-rate exposures in shaping the transmission of monetary policy.
